# Improving Reading Curricula 
## Overview of the research project
This project is undertaken as work done for the [Jackman Scholars-in-Residence 2022](https://vic.utoronto.ca/academic-programs/scholars-in-residence) 
research program, supervised by Dr Blair Armstrong at the [Computational and Psycholinguistics Lab](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/labs/caplab/personnel/) at the University of Toronto. \
The specific research focuses on improving reading curricula by developing an explicit theory of reading instruction. Broadly, the 
research is undertaken to understand how children learn to read and what kind of teaching helps pre-literate children 
acquire reading rules.
