HS04_Model4Replication: Patterns

This folder contains a corpus of 6229 unique words and five awk scripts that generate pattern files for training an implementation of the triangle model of reading in Mikenet on five mapping tasks. The files are as follows:

- 6k_AllReps_8Slot_NxF: The corpus and representations within this file are identical to those used in Chang, Monaghan & Welbourne, 2019 and contains 6229 unique words. Frequencies however were compressed into the range 0.2 -> 1 (from previous range of 0.05 -> 1) to ensure the network was able to replicate HS04 level performance within an acceptable time frame (i.e. 4 million training trials). The equation used to compress frequencies was as follows 'new_value = ((old_value - old_min)/(old_max - old_min))*(new_max - new_min) + new_min' (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_scaling, equation 2). Each row within the file represents the properties of a single word. The columns within the file are organised as follows: Word form, Frequency, Slot based orthographic form, Slot based phonological form, Semantic properties (sparsely coded: each number indicates an active semantic feature within a 2446 unit binary feature vector).

- Pho_Train_PatGen.awk: This awk script generates patterns for training networks on phonology to phonology mappings. The script takes a corpus input file arranged as in 6k_AllReps_8Slot_NxF and outputs pattern files for use in training Mikenet networks. The script converts slot based phonological forms (as in column 4 of 6k_AllReps_8Slot_NxF) into phonological vectors based on a mapping identical to that used in Chang, Monaghan & Welbourne, 2019. The training trials generated run for 8+ time steps, with a pattern clamped to the phonological layer from time step 0-6 and target presented for time steps 7 - END OF TRIAL. The script can be run from the command line using the following command:
awk -f Pho_Train_PatGen.awk NAME_OF_CORPUS_FILE > NAME_OF_OUTPUT_FILE

- Sem_Train_PatGen.awk: This awk script generates patterns for training networks on semantics to semantics mappings. The script takes a corpus input file arranged as in 6k_AllReps_8Slot_NxF and outputs pattern files for use in training Mikenet networks. The script uses sparsely coded semantic vectors (as in column 5+ of 6k_AllReps_8Slot_NxF, identical to that used in Chang, Monaghan & Welbourne, 2019). The training trials generated run for 8+ time steps, with a pattern clamped to the semantic layer from time step 0-6 and target presented for time steps 7 - END OF TRIAL. The script can be run from the command line using the following command:
awk -f Sem_Train_PatGen.awk NAME_OF_CORPUS_FILE > NAME_OF_OUTPUT_FILE

- Pho2Sem_Train_PatGen.awk: This awk script generates patterns for training networks on phonology to semantic mappings. The script takes a corpus input file arranged as in 6k_AllReps_8Slot_NxF and outputs pattern files for use in training Mikenet networks. The script converts slot based phonological forms (as in column 4 of 6k_AllReps_8Slot_NxF) into phonological vectors based on a mapping identical to that used in Chang, Monaghan & Welbourne, 2019. The script also uses sparsely coded semantic vectors (as in column 5+ of 6k_AllReps_8Slot_NxF, identical to that used in Chang, Monaghan & Welbourne, 2019).The training trials generated run for 9+ time steps, with a pattern clamped to the phonological layer from time step 0-7 and targets presented for time steps 8 - END OF TRIAL on both phonological and semantic layers. The script can be run from the command line using the following command:
awk -f Pho2Sem_Train_PatGen.awk NAME_OF_CORPUS_FILE > NAME_OF_OUTPUT_FILE

- Sem2Pho_Train_PatGen.awk: This awk script generates patterns for training networks on semantic to phonology mappings. The script takes a corpus input file arranged as in 6k_AllReps_8Slot_NxF and outputs pattern files for use in training Mikenet networks. The script converts slot based phonological forms (as in column 4 of 6k_AllReps_8Slot_NxF) into phonological vectors based on a mapping identical to that used in Chang, Monaghan & Welbourne, 2019. The script also uses sparsely coded semantic vectors (as in column 5+ of 6k_AllReps_8Slot_NxF, identical to that used in Chang, Monaghan & Welbourne, 2019).The training trials generated run for 9+ time steps, with a pattern clamped to the semantic layer from time step 0-7 and targets presented for time steps 8 - END OF TRIAL on both phonological and semantic layers. The script can be run from the command line using the following command:
awk -f Sem2Pho_Train_PatGen.awk NAME_OF_CORPUS_FILE > NAME_OF_OUTPUT_FILE

- Read_Train_PatGen.awk: This awk script generates patterns for training networks on orthographic to phonology & semantic mappings. The script takes a corpus input file arranged as in 6k_AllReps_8Slot_NxF and outputs pattern files for use in training Mikenet networks. The script converts slot based phonological and orthographic forms (as in column 3 and 4 of 6k_AllReps_8Slot_NxF) into phonological and orthographic vectors based on a mapping identical to that used in Chang, Monaghan & Welbourne, 2019. The script also uses sparsely coded semantic vectors (as in column 5+ of 6k_AllReps_8Slot_NxF, identical to that used in Chang, Monaghan & Welbourne, 2019).The training trials generated run for 9+ time steps, with a pattern clamped to the orthographic layer from time step 0-END OF TRIAL and targets presented for time steps 8 - END OF TRIAL on both phonological and semantic layers. The script can be run from the command line using the following command:
awk -f Read_Train_PatGen.awk NAME_OF_CORPUS_FILE > NAME_OF_OUTPUT_FILE
