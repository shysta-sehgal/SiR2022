Analyse_RepSim_HS04.R

The R script Analyse_RepSim_HS04.R allows the user to compare hidden layer states for comparisons of representational similarity.

The user must first test a model using HS04_Test.c to generate a file reporting the activity of one of the HS04 network's hidden layers (i.e. oshidden, ophidden, pshidden, sphidden). For example the following line of code will generate a file containing the activity of all units at time step 11 in the hidden layer that modulates activity between the orthographic and phonological layer when performing a reading task:

./HS04_Test -seed 10 -tStep 11 -task o2ps -layer ophidden -weights NAME_OF_WEIGHT_FILE -patterns NAME_OF_PATTERN_FILE.pat > NAME_OF_OUPUT_FILE.res

The R script Analyse_RepSim_HS04.R can then be used to compare the hidden layer activity on each trial performed during the above test. The R script requires the user to define the following 4 variables (lines 12 - 21):

- the working directory in which the relevant files can be found (line 12)
- the name of the results file i.e. the file generated by HS04_Test.c (line 15)
- the name of the outputted analysis file that the R script will generate (line 18)
- a parameter indicating which hidden layer is to be analysed 1 = oshidden, 2 = ophidden, 3 = pshidden, 4 = sphidden (i.e. the contents of the results file)

Once the above variables are set the script can be run. It will calculate the cosine similarity between the hidden layer activity of the network on each trial in the results file. The outputted analysis file will contain a table, each row will contain values for the cosine similarity between the hidden layer on a given trial and the hidden layer on all other trials within the results file. The row and column headings give the name of the test trials under analysis (trial names taken from the results file).
